# Draggable
- In < 100 lines of code, a fairly minimal Web Component / Custom HTML Element, that implements draggability.   We create a class which extends `HTMLElement` and uses an HTML template and the Shadow Dom.
- Included is a child class that adds styling, for demonstation of inheritability.
- Click and drag the elements to move them around the viewport.
- Experiment with changing the template.
- Use this class as a building block for draggable elements with extended functionality.
- Use it also to get a handle on the basics of Web Components:  Custom Elements, the Shadow DOM and HTML Templates.
